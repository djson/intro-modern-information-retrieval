S's one-to-one correspondence between S objects and filesystem
objects is the single remaining reason I haven't completely
converted over to R.  With S I can manage my objects via
makefiles.  Corrections to raw data or changes to analysis
scripts get applied to all objects in the project (and there
are often thousands of them) by simply typing 'make'.  That
includes everything right down to the graphics that will go
in the report.

How do people live without that?
